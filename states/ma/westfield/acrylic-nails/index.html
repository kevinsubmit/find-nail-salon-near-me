  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Acrylic Nails in Westfield, MA</h2>

  <h3>How long do acrylic nails last?</h3>
  <p>Acrylic nails often last about 2–3 weeks before needing a fill, depending on nail growth and aftercare.</p>

  <h3>What’s the difference between a full set and a fill-in?</h3>
  <p>A full set is a brand-new acrylic application. A fill-in maintains your set by filling new nail growth near the cuticle.</p>

  <h3>Are acrylic nails safe for natural nails?</h3>
  <p>When applied and removed properly by a trained technician, acrylics can be worn safely. Avoid peeling them off.</p>

  <h3>Do I need an appointment?</h3>
  <p>Some salons accept walk-ins, but appointments are recommended during evenings and weekends.</p>
