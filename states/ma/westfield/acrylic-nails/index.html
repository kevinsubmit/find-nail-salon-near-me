  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Acrylic Nails in Westfield, MA</h2>

  <h3>How long do acrylic nails last?</h3>
  <p>
    Acrylic nails typically last about 2–3 weeks before needing a fill, depending on nail growth and aftercare.
    Many nail salons offer fill-in services to keep your set looking fresh.
  </p>

  <h3>What is the difference between a full set and a fill-in?</h3>
  <p>
    A full set is a brand-new acrylic application. A fill-in is maintenance where new growth near the cuticle is filled
    so your acrylics look consistent and last longer.
  </p>

  <h3>Are acrylic nails safe for natural nails?</h3>
  <p>
    When applied and removed properly by a trained technician, acrylic nails can be worn safely.
    Avoid peeling them off yourself and follow aftercare recommendations to help protect natural nails.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I need an appointment for acrylic nails in Westfield?</h3>
  <p>
    Some salons accept walk-ins, but appointments are recommended during busy times (evenings and weekends),
    especially if you want a specific shape, length, or custom design.
