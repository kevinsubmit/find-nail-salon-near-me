  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Gel Nails in Westfield, MA</h2>

  <h3>What are gel nails?</h3>
  <p>
    Gel nails typically use gel-based polish or extensions that are cured under a UV/LED lamp.
    They are popular for a glossy finish and better chip resistance compared with regular polish.
  </p>

  <h3>How long do gel nails last?</h3>
  <p>
    Gel polish commonly lasts around 2 weeks. Gel extensions may last longer depending on nail growth,
    maintenance, and daily activities.
  </p>

  <h3>How should gel nails be removed?</h3>
  <p>
    Gel polish should be removed properly (often by soaking and gentle removal). Avoid peeling gel off,
    because it can damage the surface of natural nails.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I need an appointment for gel nails in Westfield?</h3>
  <p>
    Some salons accept walk-ins, but appointments are recommended during evenings and weekends,
    especially for gel extensions or custom gel nail art.
