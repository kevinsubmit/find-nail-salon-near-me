  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Acrylic Nails in Springfield, MA</h2>

  <h3>How long do acrylic nails last?</h3>
  <p>
    Acrylic nails typically last about 2–3 weeks before needing a fill, depending on nail growth and aftercare.
    Many salons in Springfield offer fill-in services to maintain your set.
  </p>

  <h3>What is the difference between a full set and a fill-in?</h3>
  <p>
    A full set is a new acrylic application. A fill-in maintains the set by filling new nail growth near the cuticle,
    helping your acrylics look consistent and last longer.
  </p>

  <h3>Are acrylic nails safe for natural nails?</h3>
  <p>
    When applied and removed properly by a trained technician, acrylic nails can be worn safely.
    Avoid peeling them off and follow aftercare recommendations to help protect natural nails.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I need an appointment for acrylic nails in Springfield?</h3>
  <p>
    Some salons accept walk-ins, but appointments are recommended during evenings and weekends—especially for
    longer services, specific shapes, or custom nail designs.
