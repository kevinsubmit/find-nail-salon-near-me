  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>How long do acrylic nails last?</h3>
  <p>Acrylic nails typically last about 2–3 weeks before needing a fill, depending on nail growth and aftercare.</p>

  <h3>What is the difference between a full set and a fill-in?</h3>
  <p>A full set is a new acrylic application. A fill-in maintains the set by filling new nail growth near the cuticle.</p>

  <h3>Are acrylic nails safe for natural nails?</h3>
  <p>When applied and removed properly by a trained technician, acrylic nails can be worn safely. Avoid peeling them off.</p>

  <h3>Do I need an appointment for acrylic nails in Chicopee?</h3>
  <p>Some salons accept walk-ins, but appointments are recommended during evenings and weekends—especially for nail art or longer services.</p>
